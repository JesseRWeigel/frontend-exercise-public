# Solution Docs

<!-- You can include documentation, additional setup instructions, notes etc. here -->

To optimize this solution further I would:

- Use memoization to cut down on number of requests
- Add debouncing so that searches only occur when the user stops typing

An added feature that may be good for the user experience would be to highlight the search term in the results using regex and a css class.

I would also spend some time adding additional styles and tests.
